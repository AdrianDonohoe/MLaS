    "## Task 1 - Computing Square Root of 2 to 100 Decimal Places\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to compute the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places, but without using external modules, just standard python. One of the difficulties is that standard python doesn't support floating points with the required precision. Most  web search results for extending the precision of floating points suggest to use the Decimal module. [[1]](#References)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many methods for computing the square root of a number.[[2]](#References) [[3]](#References) Eventually I settled on an algorithm called, Square Roots by Subtraction. According to the paper, I found it in, it is an old Japanese method. [[4]](#References) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Square Roots by Subtraction algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose this method because I could (mostly ) understand how it works but most importantly it uses normal integers as opposed to floating points, thereby bypassing standard pythons inability to handle large floating point decimals.As a consequence it doesnt suffer from loss of precision due to rounding errors. This method does not converge as quickly as Newton's Method.[[4]](#References) \n",

    "#### Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm has an initial step, then either step R1 or R2 is taken depending on the values of $a$ and $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initial Step \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the square root of $n$\n",
    "Let $ a = 5n $ and $ b = 5 $\n",
    "\n",
    "* Repeated Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "(R1) If $ a ≥ b $, replace a with $ a − b $, and add $ 10 $ to $ b $.\n",
    "\n",
    "(R2) If $ a < b$, add two zeroes to the end of $a$, and add a zero to $b$ just before\n",
    "the final digit (which will always be ‘5’).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the digits of $b$ approach more and more closely the digits of the square\n",
    "root of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of the Algorithm using a perfect square\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example I will try to find the square root of 25. So $a = 5n = 125, b = 5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (125,5)$  R1 $\\Rightarrow (120,15)$  R1 $\\Rightarrow (105,25)$  R1 $\\Rightarrow (80,35)$  R1 $\\Rightarrow (45,45)$  R1 $\\Rightarrow (0,55)$  R2 $\\Rightarrow (0,505)$  R2 $\\Rightarrow (0,5005)$  R2 $\\Rightarrow (0,50005)$  R2 $\\Rightarrow (0,500005)$\n",
